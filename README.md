SimpleSiteTour
---------

It is just simple site tour.

I develped it some time ago for [one](http://www.menulet.me "menulet") of my side projects and now I decide to put it to github. If it will be useful for someone - good, if not - so, I have just one more side project =)    
Sample of usage you can see [here](http://www.menulet.me "menulet").

I was inspired by some old tour(can't remember name of it)
